			<p class="biography-text">My name is Shawn Lopez II, a bit of my skills includes creative writing, event planning, and brainstorming ideas. One career I’m interested in pursuing
				is one in game design. As far as awards I’ve been given quite a few from my youth leadership organization known as DeMolay, like a membership pin, merit bars in
				scholastics, civic service, ritual and more, RD, Chevalier, among other awards. With the degree I hope to acquire, I want to be able to make games in the future for a book
				series I’ve been working on and hopefully later on an animated tv show, but I know those will take time and I’d settle for no less than a position in a company making games
				in the short term. However in the future, I’d like to create my own company and contribute my own ideas to the gaming industry.
