			<p class="biography-text">My name is Shawn Lopez II, a bit of my skills includes creative writing, event planning, and brainstorming ideas. One career I’m interested in pursuing
				is one in game design. As far as awards I’ve been given quite a few from my youth leadership organization known as DeMolay, like a membership pin, merit bars in
				scholastics, civic service, ritual and more, RD, Chevalier, among other awards. With the degree I hope to acquire, I want to be able to make games in the future for a book
				series I’ve been working on and hopefully later on an animated tv show, but I know those will take time and I’d settle for no less than a position in a company making games
				in the short term. However in the future, I’d like to create my own company and contribute my own ideas to the gaming industry.

					Ion Hazzikostas- While the state of the game World of Warcraft isn’t in its best state in current events,
					Ion Hazzikostas is a great Game Director both in the way he communicates content in the game and his skill in making raid encounters as
					well as various other pieces of content. He demonstrates a high aptitude in game development and that’s something I’d like to hope to
					match someday.

						Todd Howard- Todd Howard is responsible for creating many great games such as The Elder Scrolls series and
						Fallout 3 and 4. Much like how there are steps in designing a system, Howard also follows three steps in designing a game: great games
						are played not made, keep it simple, and define the experience. He’s a genius when it comes to the creation of games and I hope to be
						able to approach the level of skill he contributes to the gaming industry someday.
